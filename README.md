# Boilerplate

Boilerplate is a port of the Drupal 7 theme: 
https://www.drupal.org/project/boilerplate

Originally put together by Dan Linn at Metal Toad Media for use internally and is being ported to Backdrop 
as part of this discussion. https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4131

## CURRENT STATUS

This theme will load and render pages. However, only the minimal work has been done to get it working in Backdrop CMS. We need to check to see if it is doing everything needed before we push a stable release.  

Please feel free to help with this project. This is my first attempt to port a Drupal 7 theme and I could use all the help and input possible. Please, make liberal use of the issue queue.

Please, go through the current issues in the issue queue and help with anything or answer any questions. This is a learning project for me and I'll be asking questions there myself.
