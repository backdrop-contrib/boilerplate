# Boilerplate

Boilerplate is a port of the Drupal 7 theme: 
https://www.drupal.org/project/boilerplate

Originally put together by Dan Linn at Metal Toad Media for use internally and is being ported to Backdrop 
as part of this discussion. https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4131

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A STABILE PROJECT, we have just begun the port. 

Please feel free to help with this project. This is my first attempt to port a Drupal 7 module and I could use all the help and input possible. Please, make liberal use of the issue queue:
