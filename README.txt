Boilerplate was put together by Dan Linn at Metal Toad Media for use internally.  It was good enough he felt he should let others use it, too.  He agreed with the Basic theme (http://drupal.org/project/basic) developers and thought Zen was getting a little hefty.  Using elements from Basic, Boron (Another Metal Toad theme), and the HTML 5 Boilerplate 3.0, this theme was born.

Installation

- Download Boilerplate from http://drupal.org/project/boilerplate
- Unpack the downloaded file and place the Boilerplate folder in your Drupal installation under 
  one of the following locations:

    * sites/all/themes
    * sites/default/themes
    * sites/example.com/themes 

- Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to 
  Administer > Site building > Themes (admin/build/themes) and make Boilerplate the default theme.

- if you want to change the name of the theme from 'Boilerplate' to another name like 'mytheme',
follow these steps (to do BEFORE enabling the theme) :

	- rename the theme folder to 'mytheme'
	- rename boilerplate.info to mytheme.info
	- Edit boilerplate.info and change the name, description, project (can be deleted)
	- In template.php change each iteration of 'boilerplate' to 'mytheme'
	- In mytheme.info change each iteration of 'boilerplate' to 'mytheme'
	- In theme-settings.php change each iteration of 'boilerplate' to 'mytheme'

  the theme

- ie6 => used to debug IE6
- ie7 => used to debug IE7
- layout.css => define the layout of the theme

Changing the Layout

The layout used in Boilerplate is fairly similar to the Holy Grail method. It has been tested on 
all major browser including IE (5>8), Opera, Firefox, Safari, Chrome ...
The purpose of this method is to have a minimal markup for an ideal display. 
For accessibility and search engine optimization, the best order to display a page is ]
the following :

	1. header
	2. content
	3. sidebars
	4. footer

This is how the page template is buit in boilerplate, and it works in fluid and fixed layout.
Refers to the notes in layout.css to see how to modify the layout.

UPDATING boilerplate

Once you start using boilerplate, you will massively change it until a point where it has nothing
to do with boilerplate anymore. Unlike ZEN, Boilerplate is not intended to be use as a base theme for a 
sub-theme (even though it is possible to do so). Because of this, it is not necessary to
update your theme when a new version of Boilerplate comes out. Always see boilerplate as a STARTER, and 
as soon as you start using it, it is not Boilerplate anymore, but your own theme.

If you didn't rename your theme, but you don't want to be notified when boilerplate has a new version
by the update module, simply delete "project = "boilerplate" in boilerplate.info
